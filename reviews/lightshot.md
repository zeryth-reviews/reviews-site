## Demerits and Privacy Concerns
While Lightshot is efficient, there are a few concerns, particularly related to privacy. The cloud upload feature, which saves screenshots on Prntscr.com for sharing via links, can be a potential privacy risk. Once uploaded, the screenshots are stored on an open cloud, which means that anyone with access to the link can view the content. Furthermore, unless carefully managed, sensitive information might be inadvertently shared with others if the link is leaked or misused. Users should be cautious about what they upload, especially when dealing with confidential data.
